Wireless sensor networks are composed of limited power sensors, which their power supply could not be replaced or recharged. So, less power consumption will increase the lifetime of these networks. Therefore, providing efficient routing algorithms with less energy consumption is desirable. Among many routing algorithms, approaches based on clustering, result less energy consumption. In this article, all well-known routing algorithms based on clustering which focus on saving energy got reviewed. Each algorithm is described in detail and its pros and cons are discussed explicitly.

This paper adopts the classical CW-Lite security models as the framework and the human behavioral patterns as the context. The selected behavioral aspects refer to mobile application and mobility, deployed as major characteristics that determine security control decisions. This proposed paper requires the application of human behavioral context on mobile phones. The solution involves the novel use of behavioral aspects to improve the security of mobile phones. Two important scenarios are incorporated: analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mobile application and AHP mobility. The proposed methodology is superior because it can detect the change in the user behavior in comparison with an intruder. The applied intelligent human behavioral context on the CW-Lite model shows the advantages of AHP in detecting the changes in the user behavior and in authenticating the identity of the main user. These advantages ensure reliability and security of the phone.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:18","2024-03-10 16:20:01","","434-445","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision making; CW-Lite security model; User authentication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, resource is also a factor that contributes to the time and cost uncertainty. Study in the field of project reliability has evolved but there were no further study re-viewing relationship between resources and both time and cost of the project. Therefore, in this research, we developed a model to explain various type of relationship among time, cost, and resource that mostly are prioritized in the project planning.

Currently in Malaysia, the lack of existing system to analyze and monitor the student progress and performance is not being addressed. There are two main reasons of why this is happening. First, the study on existing prediction methods is still insufficient to identify the most suitable methods for predicting the performance of students in Malaysian institutions. Second is due to the lack of investigations on the factors affecting students achievements in particular courses within Malaysian context. Therefore, a systematical literature review on predicting student performance by using data mining techniques is proposed to improve students achievements. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview on the data mining techniques that have been used to predict students performance. This paper also focuses on how the prediction algorithm can be used to identify the most important attributes in a students data.

In particular, the computation of security investment does not consider the bilateral security risk, and the used threat models do not consider the particular aspects of privacy threats and attacks, which show the use of multiple steps to thief and misuse the information, and depend on the type of the stolen information and its lifetime. We provide in this work an economic security investment model, allowing firms, which outsource their IT business functions, to determine their optimal security investment and the related residual risk. In this work, threats on data privacy are modeled considering the particular aspects of privacy attacks. A numerical analysis is conducted to analyze the impact of the quality of detection and reaction to privacy breaches, on optimal investment and residual risk. The analysis shows that the amount of optimal investment depends on the minimal time period to detect a security breach, the ability of the customer firm to react to such an attack as quickly as possible, and also on the type of threat on private data. In particular it has been shown that for threats related to private information theft, the customer firm can take advantage from the delay in detecting attacks at the outsourcing provider side. Moreover, it should not also put a lot of security investment effort in reducing the reaction time to these privacy attacks. In the contrary, for threats related to privacy exploitation by self-propagating malware, the customer firm has not to contact with an outsourcing company which is not committed to report an attack occurrence within a short delay, and should not to put a lot of security investment effort in reducing the reaction time to these attacks.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:19","2024-03-10 16:20:19","","569-579","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","economics of privacy; optimal security investment; Outsourcing; privacy threats modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However there has been little research done regarding the businesses that were set up on Instagram especially research that focus on branding strategies. It's fascinating to note that businesses on Instagram are still pretty much under the radar even though it generates sales equivalent to a proper e-commerce business. This study sought to investigate and explore this phenomenon and understand how the business owners strategized their brand positioning. Qualitative research of in-depth interview has been undertaken with three respondents that are business owners themselves and the finding showed that Instagram is the best and current platform for aspiring business owners to start their business before deciding to venture offline. Three types of businesses were chosen with current followers of more than 10,000 and as this research was done, all three business owners had already make plan for offline expansion.

For each binary SVM classifier, the cross entropy method is applied to solve dual SVM problem to find the optimal or at least near optimal solution, in the feature space through kernel map. For the meantime only RBF kernel function is investigated intensively. Experiments were done on four real world data sets. The results show one-against-rest produces better results than one-against-one in terms of computing time and generalization error.

In order to realise APA as a tangible deliverable, a number of automated tools which are called Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APAS) have been developed and tested for decades. Basically, the need for decreasing the load of work among lecturers, timely feedback to students and accuracy on the grading results are the common reasons that motivate the need for APAS. In order to carry out a dynamic testing in APA, it is necessary to prepare an appropriate and adequate set of test data to judge the correctness quality of students’ programming solutions in terms of the aspects of functional and/or structural testing. Manual preparation of quality test data becomes a hard, time consuming, and feasible task in the practice of both software testing and APA. Thus, the generation of automated test data is highly desirable to alleviate the humans’ burden from performing repetitive tasks. This paper aims to describe the design, implementation and user experience when evaluating a tool developed to support APA as a test data generator that is called FaSt-generator. The tool plays an important role to furnish a test set that includes an adequate set of test data to execute both the functional and structural testing in APA.

How to evaluate the information credibility on social media platform has become an important issue for today information consumers. Despite its importance, little research has empirically examined what factors influence the information credibility on social media platforms, which limits our understanding of the determinants of online information assessment. To fill this gap, this study examines the factors that influence individuals’ perceived information credibility on social media platforms. Drawing on the persuasion theory—the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), we identify that five factors from two dimensions of credibility (medium and message credibility) are key ingredients in the online information assessment, and develop a research model that predicts individuals’ perceived information credibility on social media platforms. We test and validate the proposed model with empirical data from 135 users of the Facebook page. The results show that interactivity, medium dependency from the medium credibility dimension and argument strength from the message credibility dimension are main determinants of the information credibility.

One way to maintain the security of computer networks is using network-based Intrusion Detection System (N-IDS). Here, machine learning-based IDS has been gaining more attention than other methods for decades. In more details, feature representation is one of the methods which is used to classify data in machine learning. A small amount of good features is able to increase the accuracy of detection process and also to decrease the cost of computation; and for some cases, it gives the network administrator some idea what needs to do. Some research has been done in order to find good features. Nevertheless, it is relatively not good as represented by its accuracy. This paper proposes a new method to generate a representative feature to classify normal and anomalous connections. In this approach, two types of distance are measured and summed to generate a new feature. The first is the distance whose value is the sum of data item to cluster centers; while the second is the distance whose value is sum of log distance from data to its cluster sub-centroids. This new one-dimensional data is used to classify new data using k-nearest neighbor classifier.

Some basic ideas on the approach to the data level by using sampling-based approaches to handle this classification issue are under sampling and oversampling. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is one of oversampling methods to increase number of positive class using sample drawing techniques by randomly replicate the data in such way that the number of positive class is equal to the number of negative class.

In designing the model, this research has reviewed ECMS literature that provides insight on how these technologies work. ECMS researchers point to two possible ways to understand and explore how ECMS is used to support business operations. These two possible ways provides a direction to this study which is, to: (1) consider organization's business process structure as a starting point to understand ECMS-use; and (2) examine the interaction between technologies (ECMS), the organizational context, processes, business needs and users that shape certain ways of using these technologies. At the end of this paper, a research model that guide practitioners to understand ways to maximize and benefit from ECMS-use is presented. Business and IT managers could use the model to better understand ways to apply ECMS in their daily work practices to conduct business. On the other hand, IS researchers could use this model to further conduct empirical investigation to get a deeper understanding of ECMS-use and uncover qualities that have not been discovered in this study.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:26","2024-03-10 16:20:56","","194-200","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","business processes; enterprise content management; Enterprise Content Management Systems (ECMS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of process mining implementation is firstly to discover the typical customer fulfilment business process. It is also aimed at assessing the current rate of completed customer fulfilment, the typical component required for the process and the lead time for different types of customer requests. The steps to achieve the goals are to prepare, extract the data and construct the event log from the company's in house built Customer Relationship Management systems. The event log is then processed using Disco and PROM tools. The complete event log when model with Disco results in a Spaghetti-like process model with 673 different variants. In order to identify typical process, the log is filtered to include only business variants with 1% case occurrence of the total case. This enables the identification of 18 typical business variants, which differ based on the order requested, sequence of activities and occurrence of Return Work Order. Based on the typical variants, the components required to fulfil a certain order are identified. Another important findings are the fact that the completion rate is very low (only 8%). This may due to the fact that the issues faced by the field officer in processing the order and the resolution are either recorded manually or in a different systems. Finally, findings from this study can be used by the company to improve their current business process. It also stressed out the importance of resolving data integration issues in implementation of process mining in real cases.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:26","2024-03-10 16:20:05","","588-596","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Customer Order Fulfilment; Process Mining; Unstructured Process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research evaluates OpenBCI for Motor Imagery application, especially whether the OpenBCI Spiderclaw V1 headwear electrodes placements are sufficient for motor imagery application. OpenBCI 32 bit board with daisy chain (16 channels) was used in this research. OpenVibe's motor imagery CSP scenarios were adopted. After subjects had finished working with the OpenVibe motor imagery scenarios, they were asked to fill Movement Imagery Questionnaire-3 (MIQ-3). MIQ-3 results were used to validate whether subject suffer from “BCI illiteracy”. It could be concluded that the OpenBCI Spiderclaw V1 electrodes placements are not optimum for motor imagery application. The average of accuracy measurements which was around 60% for all subjects shows poor motor imagery performance. Furthermore, 16 channel electrodes configuration with a wide temporal filter range [8-30Hz] showed better performance compared to other settings in this research. However, further study is needed to improve the statistical significance of these findings.

This plant has various unit operations, such as economizer, evaporator, superheater, steam drum, and turbine. To design WHRG plant, steam drum needs to be controlled in the first place, for the reason that this unit operation will affect steam quality utilized to drive the turbine. There are three finest control elements which can be applied on steam drum; they are level control, pressure control, and mass flow rate control. The control structure on steam drum has deficiency on overcoming the load change value. To handle this problem, WHRG plant needs the other control structure. Plantwide control (PWC) is one of control method to handle the default load changes value. There are two kinds of design methods part based on PWC, the first part is top-down and the second part is bottom-up. Top-down part is a method used to optimize a particular process by determining the advantageous function, while bottom-up part is a method used to maintain the stability rate of the system. Since this study was aimed to control WHRG plant by considering the stability rate, bottom-up part was utilized. The stages used in designing the research based on bottom-up part are determining the operational objectives and limitations, analyzing the degree of freedom in the form of degree of freedom value used to calculate the total of manipulated variable (MV), determining variable process needs controlling, determining the manipulator of production rate, determining the structure of regulatory control layer, determining the adjustment of controller based on Relative Gain Array (RGA) method, and administering open loop test derived from the resulted system's responses. Based on PWC method, there are three kinds of control structures; they are boiler follow (BFC), turbines follow (TFC), and coordinate controller (CC). The output response resulted by this simulation show that CC is the most precise control structure to handle the load changes on WHRG plant. It can analyze with low value of IAE, settling time, and maximum overshoot of the control result. The IAE value of CC is 857.3439, BFC = 1182.895, while TFC = 887.1246. CC control structure produces IAE better than BFC and TFC. Hence, the precise control structure for WHRG plant is CC.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:28","2024-03-10 16:20:15","","170-177","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Plantwide control; Three control elements; Tuning; Waste Heat Recovery Generation (WHRG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, heterogeneous data from varied sources needs to be normalized and integrated, ideally using a common structured vocabulary. Furthermore, to provide users with both real-time and aggregate views on the data, data stream access requires support for temporal operators. Finally, it is difficult for non-technical users to integrate and leverage streaming data. To tackle these challenges, we propose an extension of the Linked Widgets concept for the streaming data domain.

Such a pump consits of a stepper motor, gear box and rotor shaft with two roller attached on it. The transported volume of the pump depends on the tube segment pressed by roller. Therefore, the deviation in the amount of delivered fluid may occurs. It is a problem when it is used in the medical device with high accuracy requirements such as hemodialysis machine. To overcome such a problem, the transport of fluid need to be controlled. The aim of this work was to design and implement of an embedded microcontroller for controlling and monitoring fluid transport in the peristaltic pump. An electronic hardware which consists of STM32F4 development board, stepper motor driver circuit, current sensor, magnetic sensor and arterial presure sensor circuits was developed in parallel with embedded software development. The embedded sofware consists of routines for monitoring current sensor, pressure sensor, and magnetic sensor, as well as routines for pump speed controller. The STM32F4 board which consits of ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller was chosen because of the trade off between price, performance, and low power consumption. The peristaltic pump system was tested with the mixture of water and glycerin with certain composisition and having viscosity simular to human blood.

In Reality, software project planning has not been only effort estimation, but also cost estimation to estimate how much cost of resource allocation spent in software development. Result of the effort estimation using UCP is the number of effort required to develop the software as a whole. In fact, the determination of the cost of software development is based on the cost per activity of pay rate different in each phase of software development. Therefore it requires the distribution of effort per activity to get the cost of software development. To produce cost estimation in the software development project, we need to know the percentage of each phase of software development, in this case called the effort distribution.

However participants are not always interested in or committed to such drills. To improve this situation, we focused on Edutainment and proposed game-based evacuation drill (GBED) using the Real-World Edutainment (RWE) program. There are two types of GBED systems, i.e. the Tablet-based GBED (T-GBED) and the AR and HMD-based GBED (AH-GBED). We conducted GBED at several schools and determined that it can improve student motivation for disaster prevention. Subduction-zone earthquakes frequently generate tsunamis and can cause catastrophic damage especially to coastal areas. Thus people in coastal areas must move very quickly to evacuation sites when a massive earthquake occurs. Both GBED systems cannot be used directly for tsunami evacuation drills because the participants will not want to sprint while holding a tablet or wearing a HMD and have time to stop to view the digital materials. In this study, we propose a tsunami evacuation drill (TED) and have developed a TED system. The TED system uses smart glasses (a lightweight optical see-through HMD) which allows participants to view digital materials while moving quickly.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:38","2024-03-10 16:20:58","","329-336","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","disaster education; smart glasses; tsunami evacuation drill; wearable devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This distance is determined from the coupling value of two nodes. A closely related nodes will move closer until reaching a short distance. On each iteration, node position is dynamically updated based on attraction and repulsive force around them. Thus, gradually forming a near best solution of logical coupling graph.

Such imbalance severely reduces bag-of-poses based classification performance. On the other hand, collecting a dataset of human gestures or actions is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. It is often impractical to reacquire the data or to modify the existing dataset using oversampling or undersampling procedures. The best way to handle such imbalance is by making the used classifier be directly aware and adapt to the real condition inside the data. Balancing class distribution, i.e., the number of pose samples per class, is one of difficult tasks in machine learning. Standard statistical learning models (e.g., SVM, HMM, CRF) are insensitive to unbalanced datasets. This paper proposes a distribution-sensitive prior on a standard statistical learning, i.e., Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), to deal with the imbalanced data problem. This prior analyzes the training dataset before learning a model. Thus, the RVM can put more weight on the samples from under-represented classes, while allows overall samples from the dataset to have a balanced impact to the learning process. Our experiment uses a publicly available gesture datasets, the Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Experimental results show the importance of adapting to the unbalanced data and improving the recognition performance through distribution-sensitive prior.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:38","2024-03-10 16:20:18","","527-534","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Distribution-Sensitive Learning; human gesture recognition; Relevance Vector Machine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BCI processes brainwave which recorded by means of electroencephalography so it is can be known to computers. Inside the brain, nerve impulses is passed across corresponding nerves to command body part into action, as a result, the respective body part responded with the action that brain commanded. This chain of events can be harnessed by BCI so that brainwaves can be acquired. Using a proper classification method, brainwaves data can be used as a digital command to computer, eliminating the need of actual real-world action to act in a computer. One of the BCI's interesting topic is Motor Imagery, a topic which deeply examine brain activity when imagining motoric activity such as moving left hand. Brain activity is recorded by electroencephalography so that BCI can use the data as a reference to translate brain activity into actual motor activity or as computer trigger. Emotiv EPOC is one of the common BCI distributed to public users. The purpose of this research is to determine how BCI can identify and distinguish human's brainwave when performing different activities. Emotiv EPOC is used in this research with a purpose of whether Emotiv EPOC can be used for Motor Imagery. A simple method is used in this research, using Graz BCI scenario provided in OpenVibe installation bundle and then assess the test results with 5seconds timeframe. A total of 6 scenarios is used for testing purpose. The success rates of those 6 scenarios are: scenario 1 with 76,67% success rate, scenario 2 with 91,67% success rate, scenario 3 with 28,33% success rate, scenario 4 with 13,33% success rate, scenario 5 with 60% success rate, and scenario 6 with 76,67% success rate.

Citramart Minimarket as a retail business has not yet been used that grouping and consideration in their sales information system for processing their item's minimum stock level and profit margin. The process is still done manually by arbitrary observations from a stock division staff. The categories that is used to determine the minimum stock and profit margin are also not the moving speed of item but rather the kind of items. This study aim to support the process of determining the minimum stock and profit margin by building a model that can group items into categories ‘fast moving’ and slow moving’ using k-means clustering. K-means clustering is used in this study because the number of clusters required in categorization of items already set. The group cluster which has highest centroid will be the fast moving group, while the lowest centroid is the slow moving group. The data to be used in the research is taken from sales data for year 2014 and 2015. The clustering scenario uses combination of time, e.g. yearly and monthly, and variable, e.g. count of items and their transaction values. Using 3 clusters and delta value 0.2, the resulting best scenario is using yearly time and transaction value variable. The test is conducted by calculating the xie-beny index which results 36.265.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:41","2024-03-10 16:20:25","","495-502","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","k-means clustering; minimal stock; profit margin; retail","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A more demanding approach is expected from the OOAD method to improve software development process. To address this issue, this paper use Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) as integrated software process improvement standard and approach. The purpose of CMMI is to improve process in creating product or services within organization. Therefore, the idea of improving process using CMMI will be applied for optimizing OOAD. The proposed method in this study is by constructing checklist criteria which already comply with requirement development process area in CMMI. Each criterion will be given certain score, then the score will summarize into total number from the assessment towards the Unified Modeling Languange (UML) Diagrams. The result obtained score of 185 for all criteria in the checklist and achieved 77,08% of CMMI level implementation, which categorized into Large Implementation (LI).

One of solutions that often implemented in the fishery management is by calculating the value of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) as the maximum tolerable harvest that can be taken out from the natural stock without harming the population over an indefinite period of time. A proper tool used for computing the MSY is needed to support the fishery manager in solving this decision making problem. In this paper we propose a software development of Decision Support System (DSS) to address such fishery industry problem. The DSS is developed to compute the MSY from the annual yield-effort data of the fishery. We use two sigmoid growth equations, Logistic and Gompertz equations, as the underlying population models, which then are approximated by their discrete forms for computing several growth parameters. Most known methods of growth parameter estimation use a Multiple Linear Regression with Ordinary Least Square method (MLR-OLS). Here we propose the application of Artificial Neural Network with Linear Perceptron method (ANN-LP). A case study in this paper shows that the effectiveness of the proposed ANN-LP is as good as the MLR-OLS in estimating both the growth parameters and the MSY of the fishery in the case study needed in the computation of its MSY by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Linear Perceptron.","2015-01-01","2024-03-10 16:18:43","2024-03-10 16:20:50","","67-77","","","72","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ANN; DSS; Gompertz; Linear Perceptron; Logistic; MSY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The algorithm entails two steps: first, the event log is sliced according to the pool attribute, and then the pool dependency network (PDN) is discovered. Second, the inter-pool dependency is calculated to connect the PDNs, the result of which is a process model represented as an integrated dependency network (IDN). Duplicated task is only allowed within a different pool to clearly separate the activity context in IDN.

ERP implementation is expected to increase efficiency of the procurement operation in terms of cycle time reduction. The process mining results show that some of the activities are very uncontrolled i.e. sometimes it can be done in a short time but in other cases it took a long time. The activity can be done quickly because the procedure is bypassed. The bottlenecks occur due to technical issues (error in the systems), data migration issues (the introduction of new material numbering and categories) and cultural issues (high dependency of hard copy approval). These issues need to be resolved so that the company can realize the operational efficiency benefit and eventually long-term strategic benefit of ERP implementation.","2017-01-01","2024-03-10 16:21:44","2024-03-10 16:21:44","","216-223","","","124","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Post Implementation review; Process Mining; Procurement; SAP Materials Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vehicles send some information about road status and traffic. Due to recent growth of software technology, it becomes necessary to make a step toward using software to check on this network before the implementation. Simulation tools give us a comprehensive study of the network before applying it in a real environment. There are many network simulators which has their own features to distinguish it from other. We should focus on choosing the best one that gives the best results. NS2 is the most common simulator tool, in this project we used NS2 to design the network, which made communication within the network with different routing protocols. We compare many different routing protocols (AODV, AOMDV, DSDV and DSR) based on the various common metrics, throughput, end to end delay, and packet delivery ratio by varying the number of mobile vehicles while applying CBR traffic. The comparison has been done by using simulation tool NS2. To build the network scenario more like a real environment, different mobility models will be considered. Two type of mobility patterns were used in our project. Studying about different routing protocols give us an idea of using the best protocol in different cases under various parameters of a network. We wrote a TCL Script on NS2 to evaluate the behavior of routing protocols that used in VANET network. After executing the simulation in different mobility models, we realized that AODV has the best performance at both and preferable for the large and small environment of network, but it consumes power during transmission. AOMDV gives middle results in all parameters. The large end to end delay appears in DSR protocol. However, DSDV has lower throughput and packet delivery ratio than other routing protocols with a different number of nodes. On the other hand, it acts well in E2E delay when the network size is changed.","2017-01-01","2024-03-10 16:21:47","2024-03-10 16:21:47","","682-690","","","124","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Network Performance; NS2; VANET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To come up with the proposed framework, we conducted an extensive research on the existing frameworks to identify how they handle and transfer knowledge during the development process of the SC and how they integrate the knowledge management concepts with their frameworks. Few SC frameworks were tested to figure out their efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, after detailed comparative analysis and testing, the research suggests that the proposed framework adds value to existing research and could be adopted by SC participants as a useful knowledge based framework which could increase the SC overall speed, performance and productivity.

This resulted in needs to identify whether contents of news can be exploited for classification or otherwise. Hence, in this work, a study is conducted to analyze and determine the relevant key parts of news contents that can be to be used for sentiment-based classification. Two criteria, i.e. text Part of Speech and text position, which could possible influence the training of the classifier are studied.

The right solution tends to encourage people to use public transport instead of private cars. Within the framework of Intelligent Transport System, this paper proposes an advanced traveller information system with itinerary optimisation by Angkot, a common public transport mode in Indonesia. The itinerary optimisation is modelled as an orienteering problem and is solved using iterative local search – hill climbing algorithm. The experiment results show that generally the proposed algorithm could solve the problem fast and effectively. In addition to propose the initial algorithm, the main contribution of this paper is a new dataset for orienteering problem that may encourage researcher to come up with more sophisticated algorithm.

This situation refers to the gap of service quality that may lead to unsatisfied service consumers. This study focuses on understanding the quality gap of IT services from the perspective of service provider – that is DPTSI staffs, and of service consumers – that are lecturers and students. A gap analysis based on Parasuraman works was employed. From the perspective of service provider, a gap between service quality specifications and service delivery (GAP 3) was identified; whereas from the perspective of service consumers, a gap between expected and perceived service (GAP 5) was analyzed by employing SERVQUAL Dimensions. From the analysis, we found that the highest gap lies on the domain and hosting services due to relatively sophiscated technology and unclear flows of the service requests. From internal DPTSI, staffs agreed that control systems are the most common problem in their work. Some recommendations are proposed, e.g. developing a standard operating procedure for domain and hosting services, and allocating staffs according to their capability.

We integrate the AAM module within a BDI agent’s architecture to form an adjustable autonomous agent. The AAM module enables the agent to internally adjust its autonomy and handles external autonomy adjustments. We apply the agents in an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system. We test the UAV in a dynamic environment via experimenting aerial surveillance missions. The test results show that the agent-based UAV system successfully operates in the dynamic environment and performs the aerial surveillance missions.

In general, it requires a software development standard procedure to meet software quality assurance. In Kemlu the standard procedure in software development becomes more critical due to frequent changes among IT team members. It is the nature of this organization to send their staffs to foreign countries for several years. Then they are back to home country for another couple of years, and get ready for their next assignments abroad. A fundamental step in a software development standard procedure is determining the most suitable software development method. However, there was lack of investigation for this selection. To address this problem, a study using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is conducted.

The application of existing symbolic analysis can eliminate the information contained in those signals. This paper proposes a method of symbolic analysis by taking into account the size of symbolic signal changes. Symbols are divided into two groups: that for the increasing signal and decreasing one. To store the signal amplitude information, three groups of divisions are proposed i.e., amplitude less than one times standard deviation, that is more than or equal to one times standard deviation to less than two times standard deviation and more than two times standard deviation. The probability of each symbol in a series of data is calculated. Besides, Shannon entropy of all the data on each sample was also calculated. The result suggests that the probability of each symbol has a significant difference between the normal subject and patients with congestive heart failure.","2017-01-01","2024-03-10 16:22:04","2024-03-10 16:22:04","","197-204","","","124","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","congestive heart failure; heart rate variability; Symbolic dynamic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, at the time of the distribution process performed, a problem could occur. A complicated ordering flow can be one of the problem as happened in the distribution of medicine to pharmacies or hospitals. Medicine can be ordered when distributors assign some of its salesman for visiting pharmacies or hospitals and offer medicine to be sold. Pharmacies who will order must create a letter and handed it to the salesman. All orders from some pharmacies or hospitals will be entered into the order book manually by the salesman. Afterwards, order book returned to distributor and after going through several process again, the order will be sent to the pharmacy or hospital. That issue is the topic of this research, which at the time of delivery of order, courier could be negligent. Therefore, courier needs to be monitored to determine whether the order has been shipped or not. The purpose of this research is to design and build a courier monitoring system. Application is an android based application using GPS Location to trace courier location, and Android Cloud to Device Messaging for push notification feature. There are three modules for users of this application. Application in part one will be used by the medicine distributor company. The second one are used by the salesman to make an order while at the customer premises. The last part are used by the courier for order information and customer location.

Community detection is a task in network analysis which aims to find sets of tightly connected nodes that are loosely connected with other nodes outside of those sets. In our study, we focused on a citation network which depicts relationships between cited papers and the papers which cite those papers. The objectives of our study are to identify communities of papers based on the citation relationships and analyze the similarities of topics within each community. The approach of our study to reach the objectives is by applying LinkRank algorithm to a citation network. LinkRank algorithm is chosen because it can be applied to a directed network where other algorithms that we have surveyed can only be used on undirected network. The citation network that we used in our study is from Aminer website. In applying the algorithm, we had to port the original source code which is written in C programming language into Python programming language for our convenience in doing the experiment. The result shows that the algorithm able to detect 10,442 communities from 188,514 nodes. Once the communities have been detected, we sampled top three communities (the ones with the largest number of members) and took the top 10 nodes with the highest PageRank score in each of those communities. The samples show that most of the nodes have similar topic, but there are still some nodes with different topics mixed inside the same community. We found the ratio between nodes with similar and different topics to be 7 to 3, that is 70% of the nodes have similar topic while the other 30% have different topics. Thus, the homophily of each community does not reach 100%. Nevertheless, our study confirms that LinkRank algorithm can be used for community detection on directed network.","2017-01-01","2024-03-10 16:22:08","2024-03-10 16:22:08","","29-37","","","124","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Network; Community Detection; Complex Network; Directed Network; LinkRank Algorithm; Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adoption motives, however, are situational, urging motivational studies to be contingent on the context. The purposes of this paper are therefore twofold: (1) reflecting on the case of Indonesian e-voting initiative, to examine the local government’s motives behind e-government adoption; (2) to identify emerging themes that might have influenced the process of e-voting adoption in several Indonesian villages. Qualitative data were collected from five government leaders at both municipal and village levels in a municipality that have previously conducted village e-voting elections. This study found that performance-related rationalities, i.e. cost-savings, reducing service delivery-time, are the main drives for e-voting adoption in this case. Although instances of motives belonging to technological and strategic clusters have also been recorded, none of the leaders responded to operation-related motives. This might be due to the simplistic interpretation of e-voting as merely a replacement for paper-ballots, while its broader implication to democratic values and election best practices have been largely ignored. Moreover, it was evident from the study that the decision to adopt voting technology in this case has been significantly influenced by political interests, where strong cases of leadership further accelerated the adoption process. The strong determination exhibited by higher level leaders has put significant pressures on the lower level authorities to implement e-voting, which might have conflicted with their own organizational strategy, socio-cultural norms, and citizen preparedness. This study is important to identify context-based rationales behind e-voting initiatives in Indonesia and the results are relevant to assist Indonesian government in the development of other e-government strategy in the future. This paper further emphasizes for a broader strategy which takes account of the risks of impairing democratic values and generating conflicts during electoral processes.","2017-01-01","2024-03-10 16:22:09","2024-03-10 16:22:09","","362-369","","","124","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adoption Motives; Developing Country; e-Government; e-Voting; Indonesia; Technology Adoption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research was conducted on undergraduate business students enrolled in one of the business management courses (n = 103) and analyzed using multiple regression, a questionnaire was administered to the students and data analysis was conducted. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the student’s prior knowledge and experience, the lecturer’s prior knowledge and experience, and the course context positively influenced the level of knowledge sharing. In addition, the analysis demonstrated that the student’s self-efficacy, the lecturer’s characteristics, and the diversity in team structure have no significant influence on knowledge sharing. The implication of the study is that lecturers need to promote the students the importance of knowledge sharing as well as understanding their subject and cultivate a positive course context and learning environment to encourage knowledge sharing among the students.","2017-01-01","2024-03-10 16:22:10","2024-03-10 16:22:10","","287-299","","","124","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Discussion Cases; Educators; Environmental Factors; Knowledge Sharing; Knowledge Sharing Motivation; Students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initially, a preliminary an open-ended questions survey has been conducted to explore what factors motivate citizens to use the City113. The findings factors were compared to existing prominent technology adoption models (including TAM, DOI, UTAUT, TRA, TPB, and DTPB) and suggested the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) model with a new construct specific to gamification called playfulness is the most suitable model for representing user acceptance of the e-government citizen report application. We perform the analysis using SPSS and SmartPLS for validity and reliability test and inferential analysis for validating the model. The data were collected using questionnaire targeting citizens in 7 sub-districts of Surabaya city. The number of sample size is calculated using Slovin formula collecting 156 valid responses. This study suggests that the most significant determinant of user’s intention to use the City113 mobile application is attitude (R2 = 0.435, t=5.238). There are only two factors influencing the attitude towards using the City113: Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness.

Even though IT services are provided and maintained by the ICT Directorate, IT local in each unit can use his discretion to develop his own IT initiatives. Ideally, the IT local should respond to any incident occurred in his unit before he escalates the incident to the directorate. Nevertheless, in most cases, IT locals pass through their own checking process while in fact, some incidents were originated from units. Thus, the ICT Directorate realizes the need to explore incidents that usually occurred in units and propose a solution to handle similar incidents happened in the future. This paper presents the work to identify major incidents which frequently occurred in units and from which propose Work Instructions (WI). The identification of incidents was conducted using Root-Causes Analysis while the categorization of major incidents was performed using Failure Modes, Effects and Critically Analysis.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning method that can be used for classification on the high-dimensional dataset. Therefore, reducing data dimensions will simplify and accelerate the classification process. Feature selection will eliminate irrelevant features so that it can improve the quality and accuracy of classification and can accelerate the learning process. Several approaches have been carried out for the feature selection process, including the feature selection with wrapper-based approach. Wrapper-based algorithm used in this research is Crazy Particle Swarm Optimization (CRAZYPSO) and Advanced Binary Ant Colony Optimization (ABACO). Both of CRAZYPSO and ABACO algorithm are inspired by the movement behavior of animal in finding food sources. This research uses k-fold cross-validation accuracy to compare the CRAZYPSO and ABACO algorithm for feature selection in the case of microarray data classification using Support Vector Machine Classification.

In the Philippines, the national e-government initiatives continue to progress. However, there is a lack of empirical studies on the local e-governments level. Thus, in order to determine the country’s current local e-government development, this paper examined the maturity level of websites in the municipal and city governments in the country and identified the issues associated with its e-government development. Using the United Nation (UN) e-government maturity model, 150 local government websites were assessed based on the model’s online service component. Through a stratified sampling method, the population was divided into sub-groups based on income classifications of municipalities and type of cities. Interviews were also conducted to key informants from local offices to determine possible issues associated with e-government development. The results show that several of the local governments are still on a basic (emerging) stage. The highly urbanized cities, on the other hand, showed that most of their websites are already on stage two (enhanced), in which it can accommodate simple one-way communication services. Moreover, among the reasons behind the lag of e-Government progress are the lack of technological infrastructure and skills, organizational issues and lack of government regulations among others. This study can be used to develop a plan to improve e-government services as well as supporting evidence on the status of e-government websites in the Philippines.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:21","2024-03-10 16:24:21","","99-106","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","e-Government; Philippines; UN maturity model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These features of the microtext become a particular challenge to the text classification. These features cannot be processed directly as in the traditional text processing, because it may lead to inaccuracy. Therefore, it requires microtext normalization to transform these features into well-written texts before applying text processing. This research aims to normalize some of these features, which are abbreviations and acronyms. The normalization applied dictionary-based and longest common subsequence (LCS) approach to the microtext in Bahasa Indonesia. Dictionary-based has shown an excellenct performance instead of LCS.

When combined with high national demands, it is even more difficult to address with limited capacity building resources such as trainers and financing. This research aims to explore the potentials of digital learning tool as part of a national HIS capacity building strategy, drawing from a case from Indonesia. The country is adopting District Health Information Software (DHIS2) to integrate health data and to promote quality health information use. DHIS2 implementation will be expanded to 463 districts by 2022. As the consequence, the country needs efficient tools and strategies to build capacity to fulfill this need. A joint team consisting of MoH, Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and University of Oslo (UiO) localized a global digital learning platform called DHIS2 Online Academy and successfully recruited 627 learners and graduated 150 learners. Although approximately half of the responding learners claimed to have no past online learning experience, nor DHIS2 experience, they reported that they found digital learning materials convenient for them to improve their competencies in DHIS2 implementation, in terms of time, cost, and learning style. DHIS2 Online Academy Indonesia allows wider delivery of DHIS2 learning materials to health workers, supporting HIS strengthening at district and facility level. This paper discusses potentials and challenges of localization of generic learning platform and its integration to national capacity building strategy, summarizes the key principles and the way forward.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:25","2024-03-10 16:24:25","","195-203","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","capacity building; digital learning material; health information systems; localised learning; MOOC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many analytical methods related to cardiac autonomic modulation, for instance, time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear analyses. The previous study has been using PUCK as a new index to evaluate the ANS activity and MSE for analysis of cardiovascular disease. However, the indication of PUCK showed another possibility of the cardiac modulation. Therefore, the objective of this research is to know the relation between MSE with ANS activity from several physical activities using treadmill exercise. An accurate control of heartbeat interval during exercise is measured using wearable electrocardiograph to get high precision. MSE analysis may provide to detect several cardiovascular diseases. The information related to the entanglement of the ANS of the heart rate using MSE is lacking, even though the MSE method in the clinical analysis is widely accepted. As a result, MSE in the large scales tend to decrease following the change of posture and the increasing of speed during treadmill exercise. The present study shows that MSE could indicate the activity of ANS in the large scales for the parasympathetic system activity.

With the emergence of positive psychology (PS), positive psychologists started to fill the literature gap which addresses the influence of individual’s positive traits on employees’ performance and organizational productivity and how it could be improve it by identifying these traits and build organizational policies based on them. Unlike traditional psychology, PS focuses on the employees’ positive individuals’ traits rather than on curing the negative psychological aspects of the individual. This research identifies three such positive traits, - Optimism, Well-Being and Personal Strength and analyses their impacts on employees’ productivity, hence organizational productivity. The research explicitly investigates these three positive traits, their identification and the development of a policy based on these aiming at positive effects on increasing the employees’ performance, hence their productivity. The research proposes a “process” and a “framework” which reflect the relationships between Positive Psychology traits, employees’ performance and Organizational Productivity. Hypotheses were drawn from the framework and a questionnaire was prepared to collect data to verify the validity of the relationships proposed on the framework. The questionnaire was administered on employee in a selected organization. Each hypothesis was tested, and the results were analyzed using statistical approaches. The results demonstrated quite interesting findings which demonstrated that, implementing positive psychology concepts and individual positive traits such as optimism, well-being and personal strength at the workplace increase employees’ performance hence organizational productivity, and this was verified by the acceptance of all the hypotheses following the data analysis.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:37","2024-03-10 16:24:37","","226-232","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","employees' performance; organizational policies; organizational productivity; positive psychology; positive traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automating this step enables a project to produce quality results. We categorized issue reports to derive a specific classification of issue reports of pull-based development projects. Given that manual classification of issues is a tedious task and needs an expert domain knowledge, auto-classification is extremely needed. We considered different strategies and developed diverse text analytics techniques for automatic labelling issue reports of a GitHub’s project.

In Indonesia, the most common diabetes microvascular complications diseases are retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. In order to prevent these complications to manifest, data mining technique to extract knowledge of risk factor for each complication becomes crucial. The goal of this research is to construct a prediction model for three major diabetes complication diseases in Indonesia and find out the significant features correlated with it. In this research, the diabetes risk factor narrowed into seven features, which are Age, Gender, BMI, Family history of diabetes, Blood pressure, duration of diabetes suffers and Blood glucose level. Thus, Naive Bayes Tree and C4.5 decision tree-based classification techniques and k-means clustering techniques were used to analyze this dataset. After this analysis, we evaluated the performance of each technique and found the correlated feature and sub feature as a disease risk factor for them. Resulting the most influential risk factor for Retinopathy is a female patient that having a hypertension crisis.

The goal is to provide empirical evidence as well as additional information on knowledge sharing among students in group settings using discussion cases. A survey was adopted to investigate the relationships between the environmental factors, motivational factors, students’ individual characteristics, the lecturer’s role, the industry representative’s role and knowledge sharing - outside and inside of the class - on students’ learning experiences and outcomes. The framework was modified from existing frameworks and current literature’s lessons learned on knowledge sharing approaches in educational contexts. The results showed that environmental factors positively influenced the students’ knowledge sharing motivation. In addition, the industry representatives (case protagonists) active involvement in the classroom had a significant impact on the students’ knowledge sharing behaviour. This finding contributes to future directions on developing strategies to improve knowledge sharing in higher education classrooms through enhancing classroom environment as well as involving industry representatives when designing the classroom experience.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:45","2024-03-10 16:24:45","","215-225","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","discussion cases; higher education; knowledge sharing; learning; problem-based learning; teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its NP-hard nature makes this problem attractive to be studied, especially in the field of operation research and artificial intelligence. In the literature, the state-of-the-art approach for solving examination timetabling problem is meta-heuristics. However, this approach has limitation, i.e. the need for intensive problem-specific parameter tuning. To cope with this problem, a relatively new approach namely hyper-heuristics was proposed. Different from meta-heuristics that search upon solution space, hyper-heuristics search upon low-level space. This strategy makes hyper-heuristics more generic that works over cross-domain, compared to meta-heuristics that usually designed for specific problem domain. This paper reports the success of solving real-world university examination timetabling problem in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember using hyper-heuristics based on great deluge algorithm. The main contributions of this study are two folds: a new dataset and new approach for solving examination timetabling problem. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm could produce much better solutions compared to the solutions generated manually. In addition, the proposed algorithm also outperforms two benchmarking algorithms, namely hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:46","2024-03-10 16:24:46","","647-655","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Examination Timetabling Problem; Great Deluge Algorithm; Hyper-heuristics; Simulated Annealing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data-driven approach such as the statistical approach on the other hand does not need expert knowledge, but it requires data to learn the rules. In this research, we propose an approach that combines linguistic knowledge into a statistical-based G2P convertor for Khmer. We examined a simple way of adding linguistic knowledge into the statistical G2P convertor by simply inserting vowel tags into a Khmer word. Three types of vowel tags were used. The main strength of this approach is it combines the strength of linguistic knowledge and statistical-based approach, to build a robust G2P model. The information allows better modeling and prediction of the phoneme sequence, thus improving the phoneme error rate (PER) and word error rate (WER).

Alternative interest-based ranking is recommended by value-management; but it creates a huge conflict among members. While, Alternative ranking based-weight is straight-forward with low or no conflict, but it is influenced by power, such influencing reduces reliability of a decision.

However, multiplying the number of working hours with the developer’s wage is considered unfair because each developer has different competencies and performance. In addition, not much attention given to understanding how to estimate developer payroll in software development organizations by considering different competencies and performance. For those reasons, it is important to understand how to overcome the different developer’s competencies and performance in developer payroll formulation.

The lack of participation from lecturers to deliver blended learning-based courses, and the absence of policy and resources to support the participation, is seen as the main drivers of the lagging implementation of SHARE ITS. In the light of understanding these issues, the study aimed at analyzing the factors that influence the users’ resistance toward SHARE ITS implementation. The perspective of lecturers was taken into consideration based on a conceptual model developed by Lin et al. The model introduced resistance factors, including perceived threat, perceived usefulness, perceived inequity, and behavior intention. The study showed that perceived threat factor contributes to the low level of user intention toward SHARE ITS. The perceived inequity factor also influenced the perceived threat factor due to the inequalities impact toward SHARE ITS adoption.

Learning Tahsin is usually done by face-to-face involving learners and instructors, as also held as extracurricular in STT Nurul Fikri, a higher education institution focusing on IT education and character building. However, several problems occur regarding schedules, many other activities, curriculum, less organized, and low enthusiasm. Thus, the level of participation and time efficiency in learning Tahsin process is low and required improvement. Meanwhile, social media has the potential to tackle this issue through blended learning, bringing the different learning experience to ease the learning process. Naturally, the application of a new learning system is not immediately successful. The continuous evaluation is needed. This background problem motivates this study to conduct a quasi-experimental in applying blended learning to the learning Tahsin. The objective is to produce an optimal learning system consists of a fitted curriculum and learning materials, increased level of participation, time efficiency, and an established supporting organization for the learning process. The research steps include a preliminary study, data collection, learning system design, and several evaluation iterations. As a result, this study produces a blended learning system strategy for learning Tahsin using social media, with several issues to be concerned.

Variance in types of epileptic seizures provides challenge in recognizing the pattern of seizure signals from normal ones. In this paper, we discuss the classification of seizure and non-seizure conditions in epilepsy based on bandwidth features of EEG signals. These features were extracted using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This method decomposes signal into eight Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and its residue. The IMFs is then analyzed by Hilbert transform to obtain amplitude modulation bandwidth (BAM) and frequency modulation bandwidth (BFM). These features are fed as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM). We propose to combine the first four IMFs to extract bandwidth features and we implement this method on two data sets, public data set that contains signals from both extracranial and intracranial EEG, and data set OF Rumah Sakit Universitas Airlangga (RSUA) that contains signals from extracranial EEG only. The results showed that in general, the values of accuracy and specificity using combined features of first four IMFs outperformed those using features of single IMF, for all SVM kernel functions. The best accuracy and specificity on public data set were 97.3% and 98.25% respectively using RBF kernel, while the best sensitivity was gained using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features by 99.0%. The experiments on RSUA data showed that the best accuracy was 96.5% and the best specificity was 99.38% when using Mexican Hat kernel based on combined features of first four IMFs, while the best sensitivity was 94% when using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:53","2024-03-10 16:24:53","","568-576","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EEG; Empirical Mode Decomposition; epilepsy; machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The categorization process implies the identification of those types or kinds of tacit knowledge which could be externalized and measured easier than others. The paper posits that such categorization is a step in the right direction for better tacit-to-explicit transformation. Design: The paper is designed based on literary evidences supporting that some parts or instances of tacit knowledge could be more easily externalized/transformed into explicit form than other forms. This research through the analysis of opinions and ideas focuses on building up the relationship between tacit knowledge and these two constructs. The paper will introduce a comparative analysis between opinions and ideas and tacit knowledge. Findings: The relationships and correspondences between opinions/ideas and tacit knowledge are developed and a Reflection-articulation-interpretation model which demonstrates these relationships and the externalization to explicit knowledge. Practical implications: The introduced relationships between Tacit Knowledge Instances, Opinions and Ideas as well as the externalization model form the basis for proper tacit knowledge externalization based on its categorization. The authors believe that if tacit knowledge is categorized into types, this will have positive effects on improved tacit knowledge externalization.

For this reason, as suggested by Dennehy and Sammon [2], we gathered ten top cited articles from 2014 and compare them with other ten most recent articles from Google Scholar. Afterward, we categorised those papers using Theory of Workarounds [1] to understand the state of the art of the workaround studies. The contribution of this research is that we demonstrate the application of Theory of Workarounds to capture how researchers explain the workaround creation in their papers. In our best knowledge, this is the first study to do so. Also, we contribute to the Information Systems (IS) body of knowledge as to the understanding of post-IS deployment. At the end of the research, we highlight open research areas in workarounds.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:57","2024-03-10 16:24:57","","187-194","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Business Process Management; Enterprise Information Systems; Feral Systems; IT adoptions; Shadow IT; Shadow Systems; Workarounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Matrix multiplication is under the list of time-consuming problems that require s huge computational resources to improve its speedup. As many studies have shown, it is not easy to achieve high performance speedup in sequential matrix multiplication algorithm using larger input. The emphasis of this study is to propose a parallel algorithm to calculate the product of two square matrices with improved speedup performance compared to the sequential and OpenMP algorithms. In this research, biruni (super machine workstation) in the School of Computer Sciences, USM, Malaysia with General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GU) was used to parallelize the matrix product algorithm. A comparison between parallel OpenMp versions and sequential algorithm with the proposed CUDA based algorithm of this research was carried out to evaluate the speedup performance of the proposed parallel CUDA based algorithm. The overall results show that CUDA based parallel matrix multiplication is approximately 400 times faster than sequential matrix multiplication and 4 times faster than OpenMp matrix multiplication algorithms, respectively. Therefore, the proposed parallel algorithm can help the researchers working with matrix multiplication application problems. It can also help mathematicians to easily calculate the product of any two matrices and obtain the result in a shorter time.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:24:57","2024-03-10 16:24:57","","398-405","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C language; CUDA; GPGU; Matrix multiplication; parallelization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The positive change is that people’s lives are increasingly modern, but on the other hand it is disastrous for them, namely the degradation of cultural heritage which should be used as the main foundation of the nation’s civilization. As happened in Papua, some local languages have become extinct and some are threatened of extinction. Some local languages that are under threat of extinction are found in the Pegunungan Bintang regency, namely the languages of the Ngalum, Ketengban, Murop, Lepki and Arimtap tribes. Speakers of the local languages of these tribes are increasingly diminishing due to social, political and economic globalization. While on the other hand globalization brings opportunities for us to develop and preserve local languages by utilizing the sophistication and availability of information technology. As in this study, the digital dictionary application for Pegunungan Bintang local language is made using those development opportunities. This study uses qualitative method to investigate, find and manage language data of Ngalum, Ketengban, Murop, Lepki and Arimtap tribes. The collected vocabulary data turn into an android application with a prototyping approach, which is an approach that develops a device that will be developed or repaired according to user’ needs. This application has been tested and it can be run on an android smartphone by being able to translate vocabulary from Indonesian to all local languages of Pegunungan Bintang and vice versa.

However, in many universities this repetitive works was still carried out manually. It is because there are so many constraints that must be considered either from the students and lecturers’ requirement or the infrastructure such as room availability. Therefore, to automate the process of timetabling is hard problem. Scientifically, in the literature, course timetabling optimization is one of non-deterministic polynomial problems, usually abbreviated as NP-hard problem. For NP-hard problem, there is not any exact algorithm known could solve the problem within polynomial-time. The state-of-the-art methods for solving the problem are approximation algorithms that are mainly meta-heuristics. This paper presents a new approach, namely, hyper-heuristics as opposed to meta-heuristics, to cope with the need of intensive problem specific parameter tuning in meta-heuristics approach. The algorithms employed within hyper-heuristic approach presented in this paper are tabu search hybridize with variable neighborhood search. Tested over two real-world course timetabling problem datasets, the computational results from the experiments showed that the proposed algorithm could automate the process of timetabling. Furthermore, compared to the timetable produced manually, in term of soft constraint violation penalties, the proposed algorithm could improve by 1855 and 1110 respectively.

The potential for resources and nickel ore reserves is quite large in Indonesia, but nickel content in nature is very small. One type of laterite nickel ore is saprolite ore, which has small Fe and large Ni content (around 1.5 - 2.5%). In accordance with the Law No. 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining in increasing the added value of nickel ore, it is necessary to process and refine nickel ore. One of the nickel ore processing/refining technologies is through Pyrometallurgy technique. Pyrometallurgy technique involves high temperature and large energy. The reduction process is one of the nickel ore processing process using the Pyrometallurgy technique. In addition to the reduction process, the use of composites which are mixing of saprolite ore, coal, additive and bentonite has an important role. There are several factors that influence the reduction process in saprolite ore composites. The results of this reduction process are analyzed using X Ray-Difference Fluorescence (XRF). The objective of this research is to obtain an optimal factor combination of the reduction process of saprolite ore composites, which is important to develop effective, efficient and systematic methods. This study utilises a neural network approach that will produce optimal factors with the estimate on the composition in the reduction process of saprolite ore composites.

Angkutan Kota (City Transport) is a mode of transportation with a predetermined route set by the government. The price of goods delivery is influenced by a number of factors. This research aims to solve this problem using fuzzy logic system, using it will be built an automated system to calculate the transportation price needed to be paid by the customer. The rate is determined by taking into consideration the dimension of the goods and the number of angkot used. This is done because fuzzy logic system can solve problems related to calculation system that is not detailed about changes in the input. The method used in this fuzzy logic system is Tsukamoto’s. This system weights on the factors that influence the rate to calculate the accurate number. With the existence of this rate calculation system, it is hoped that the rate determined will be accurate and could maintain the rate in the normal range of angkot usage, which is economical. Tsukamoto method is one example of a method in a fuzzy logic system. In Fuzzy Design, The Rules are made to map out the conditions obtained from the user. Creating accurate rules is vital because it will affect the result. Knowledge base as an important fact source to create rules will determine the total rate need to be paid by the user.

Unsupervised learning (i.e., trace clustering in process mining) could be the option to understand the changes of a process through learning the sequential patterns. However, there was a limited study on using trace clustering to detect the concept drift. This study attempts to explore the use of trace clustering techniques (i.e., profiles) to deal with change process discovery as the one of categorization of concept drift in process mining. The results of various trace clustering approaches were compared to the ground truth determined by both domain experts and existing concept drift approach. To verify the results, a dataset from logistics process was used. The case study in logistics process shows that partition-based clustering could be used to understand the concept drift.","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:25:27","2024-03-10 16:25:27","","1122-1130","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Concept Drift; Process Mining; Trace Clusterting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Terminal Petikemas Surabaya (PT TPS) is one of the terminals in East Java which has the largest international container flow, however, container flows are not balanced by the investment in increasing the number of container fields in the port. In addition, too long the dwelling time makes the terminal need to provide special land for a very long time limit. Determination of the deadline for stacking containers to be exported needs to be considered so that land availability and capacity can be optimized. Therefore, this study will analyze the deadline for the accumulation of export containers at PT. Terminal Petikemas Surabaya. In this study, agent-based simulations will be conducted. Using dynamic of the containers movement we described the better setting time for occupation of the container yard. The changing of lifespan and middle value can decrease the Yard Occupation Ratio by 6%.

Results produced by Deep Neural Network (DNN) [2], despite its acknowledged power for various problems, typically are no better than those of other supervised algorithms with problems involving categorical variables in tabular data [3]. Because the dataset extracted from event logs that contain categorical variables can be constructed and categorized in tabular form, it is unwise to use only ordinary DNN. In this study, we showed that we can increase the accuracy of DNN on tabular data that contains categorical variables by using a technique known as Entity Embedding. To show the robustness of the method, we conducted experiments with two types of dataset, synthesis data and real-world data, and also compared its performance with other supervised learning algorithms for regression problems.

One fundamental problem is providing quality and reliable information services that provide infrastructure support that has the capability and capacity. The provision of this infrastructure can be approached with accurate and complete planning and design. The purpose of this research is to produce infrastructure architecture planning and design that forms infrastructure services. As a service, infrastructure architecture has the duty to provide quality and reliable services for end users. Applications and data which are business processes of government institutions require infrastructure parameters that are presented from the service side perception. One way to present infrastructure services for information services in business processes is by planning right before the implementation and deployment phase. At present, the discussion of infrastructure architecture that is widely used is based on the core functions of infrastructure architecture which are limited to the main development and use. These core functions usually focus on availability and modularity (scalability). Availability is usually discussed in the criticality of services that require infrastructure backup. Whereas modularity is related to an increase in the number of users or services. In this study a collaborative role was added, namely an open contribution to the service delivery cycle from the infrastructure section. This open collaborative method is a strategy to ""develop synergies"" between infrastructure service providers and service users (end-users).","2019-01-01","2024-03-10 16:25:36","2024-03-10 16:25:36","","841-850","","","161","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture Model; Gap Analysis; ICT Infrastructure; Service Quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use System Dynamic based on the consideration that this framework offers the ability to combine expert knowledge in the model and the ability to model non-linear behavior that has a significant contribution to the national salt production. System dynamic modeling is also able to associate between variables in a closed causal loop so that actions taken by changing one variable will have an impact on the initial conditions.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid quantum-classical deep learning model for cybersecurity application: domain generation algorithms (DGA)-based botnet detection. We analyzed our hybrid model’s performance compared with the classical model counterpart to investigate the quantum circuit’s effectivity as a layer in a deep learning model. We used four features of the Botnet DGA dataset: MinREBotnets, CharLength, TreeNewFeature, and nGramReputation_Alexa. The hybrid model’s quantum circuit is a combination of Pennylane’s embedding (Angle Embedding and IQP Embedding) and layers circuit (Basic Entangler Layers, Random Layers, and Strongly Entangling Layers). Also, we implemented noise models for assessing the applicability of the model for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology. We found that in some cases, the hybrid model reached high performance (maximum accuracy up to 94,7% using n=100; 93,9% using n=1,000). We discovered that the combination of Angle Embedding and Strongly Entangled delivers high accuracy, superior to the classical deep learning model in n=100 experiments).

An adaptable ES should allow the incorporation of changes that align with evolving business goals and unforeseen marketplace disruptions. In this work, we present an empirical study exploring current views on ES adaptability, which supports the hypothesis that ES adaptability is viewed as critical.

This study aims to formulate a strategy to attain alignment between IT and business in gaming companies, based on the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) with a SWOT analysis. SWOT Analysis was done based on each domain in the SAM. This research generated several specific recommendations for gaming companies in Business Strategy, IT Strategy, Organizational Infrastructure/Process, and IS/IT Infrastructure/Process domains. The key strategies obtained from this research such as strengthening product promotion and marketing and expanding networks with potential consumers, other game producers, and governments; doing research and innovation on new games and game-making technology; developing staff with training and certification, maintaining good relations, and appreciating staff achievements; formulating company strategic plans by considering the position of competitors and future market opportunities.","2022-01-01","2024-03-10 16:27:37","2024-03-10 16:27:37","","469-476","","","197","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Game industry; IT-business alignment; strategic alignment; strategic alignment model; SWOT analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, this research investigates the antecedents of Perceived Security & Privacy and Trust, namely Security Technology Protection, Security Rules & Policy, Security Responsibility Commitment, Coverage of Mobile Payment Context, and Uncertainty Avoidance. This study uses a quantitative approach using online questionnaires with 426 respondents. The results show that Perceived Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Trust strongly influence the continuance use intention of electronic money applications. Application providers should improve Security Responsibility Commitment because it can affect Trust directly or indirectly through Perceived Security & Privacy.

Perceived Risks are used to accommodate concerning security-related news that might affect online activities. Perceived Costs is used to address complaints regarding additional financial burden due to fully online learning, namely cost to access and cost to acquire equipment. SmartPLS version3 is used as the main data analysis tools. The result showed that the Theory of Planned Behaviour is indeed able to explain the use of online learning by Indonesian high school students. Perceived Risks are considered as an influence but only have minimal impact. Perceived Costs does not have any influence on online learning.

One way to measure the level of community satisfaction is by analyzing social media. Sentiment analysis can be used to analyze feedback from the public. Research related to sentiment analysis has been mostly carried out, but so far, it has focused more on opinions contained in sentences and comments and has not considered the subject of the account that posted it. On the other hand, the use of fake accounts or bots on social media is becoming more and more prevalent, so that the credibility of opinion makers is reduced. Based on these problems, this research conducted several experiments related to sentiment analysis using a machine learning approach and fake account categories to see the influence of fake accounts on sentiment analysis. The data used in this research were taken from social media Twitter. The results showed that there was an influence from fake accounts that can reduce the performance of sentiment classification. The experimental results of the two algorithms also prove that the Support Vector Machine algorithm has a better performance than the Naïve-Bayes algorithm for this case with the highest Accuracy value of 80.6%.

However, the condition of business actors in the fisheries sector can still be said to have not reached the limit of prosperity due to the lack of knowledge, processing, marketing, and technology for these business actors. Business actors in the fisheries sector often experience that technology in the fisheries sector is not yet optimal. This is inversely proportional to other business sectors, where other business sectors have used technology to carry out their business processes, which has led to an increase in the company’s productivity. As a solution to solve this problem, in this research, modeling with a system dynamics approach is carried out to determine the characteristics of the system, changes in system behavior with time, and the feedback that describes new information about the state of the system, which will then result in decisions that can be taken further. From the modeling results, it was found that the use of superior fish seeds could increase the profitability of business actors and increase the quality of feed also provided a significant increase in profitability but improving the quality of feed also increased the costs required in one harvest. Hence, the authors suggest increasing the quality of seeds rather than improving the quality of feed so that business actors can generate maximum profits.","2022-01-01","2024-03-10 16:27:52","2024-03-10 16:27:52","","617-626","","","197","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","model; productivity; simulation; Sustainable industrialisation; system dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Availability of accurate rice production data is required to measure the level of food security. This can be done by monitoring the growth phase of a food plant which is called rice phenology classification. We used Random Forest (RF) algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in Lamongan Regency, East Java in 2019 to classify rice phenology from Landsat-8 satellite imagery, which has the characteristics of imbalance case. To deal with the imbalanced issue, an oversampling technique was used for sampling minority classes. Reference data for the classification model training were collected from the Area Sampling Framework survey published by Statistics Indonesia in 2019.

The pervasive adoption of cloud computing in smart cities’ services and applications requires timely execution of tasks adhering to Quality of Services (QoS). However, the increasing use of computing servers exacerbates the issues of high energy consumption, operating costs, and environmental pollution. Maximizing the performance and minimizing the energy in the cloud data center is challenging. In this paper, we propose a performance and energy optimization bi-objective algorithm to trade off the contradicting performance and energy objectives. An evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization is for the first time proposed using system performance counters. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a realistic cloud dataset in a cloud computing environment. Our experimental results achieve higher performance and lower energy consumption compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm.","2022-01-01","2024-03-10 16:28:00","2024-03-10 16:28:00","","238-246","","","197","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Autonomous agents; cloud computing; energy-efficiency; evolutionary algorithm; genetic algorithm; multi-objective optimization; performance; quality of service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
