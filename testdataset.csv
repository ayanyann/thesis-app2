We will study this issue on the example of methods of solving the clustering problem. Currently, we have a considerable number of learning algorithms which can be used for clustering. However, not all methods can be used for solving a specific task. The article describes the technology of empirical comparison of methods of clustering problem solving using WEKA free software for machine learning. Empirical comparison of data clustering methods was based on the results of a survey conducted among students majoring in Computer Sciences and dedicated to detecting signs of Internet addiction (IA) as behavioural disorder that occurs due to Internet misuse. Empirical comparison of Expectation Maximization, Farthest First and K-Means clustering algorithms together with the application of the WEKA machine learning system had the following results. It described the peculiarities of application of these methods in feature clustering. The authors developed data instances’ clustering models to detect signs of Internet addiction among students majoring in Computer Sciences. The study concludes that these methods may be applicable to development of models detecting respondent groups with signs of IA related disorders.","","2023-09-21 04:53:24","2024-02-02 02:07:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/CKNULYHH/Klochko and Fedorets - An empirical comparison of machine learning cluste.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evolution of the discipline is reflected in the many available scientific publications. Within a timeframe of three decades, we identify approximately 4000 journal articles and conference papers of which enterprise architecture is a major topic. We conduct a holistic, systematic literature review using artificial intelligence technologies such as information retrieval, text mining and supervised learning, side-by-side with manually reading of many relevant articles. For the first time, we present a holistic historical overview of the scientific development of the discipline. We describe the current focus of enterprise architecture and make suggestions for future publications and conferences using predictive analytics. As a major result of our analysis, we find that the focus of EA research has shifted from understanding EA in the early years to managing EA today. Furthermore, we identify and investigate several current EA trend topics: We find Cloud Computing to be the trend with the strongest impact on EA and predict that this will be the case until 2020. According to our forecast, the Internet of Things will be the trend with the strongest growth in its impact on EA. Moreover, based on a comparison with the Gartner Hype Cycle, we observe a discrepancy between EA trends in academic work versus practical experiences, which presents a starting point for future research.","2018-09-01","2023-10-20 07:41:59","2023-10-20 07:41:59","2023-10-20 07:41:59","70-84","","","100","","Computers in Industry","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/IDWGG7B9/S0166361517306723.html","","","Text mining; Systematic review; Enterprise architecture; Trend analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because online roadshow is accessible through digital devices anywhere and anytime. In a physical roadshow, organizations can measure the effectiveness of the roadshow by interacting with the customers. However, organizations cannot monitor the effectiveness of the online roadshow by using the same method. A good user experience is important to increase the advertising effects on the online roadshow website. In web usage mining, clustering can discover user access patterns from the weblog. By applying a clustering technique, the online roadshow website can be further improved to provide a better user experience. This paper presents a review of clustering techniques used in web usage mining, namely the partition-based, hierarchical, density-based, and fuzzy clustering techniques. These clustering techniques are analyzed from three perspectives: their similarity measures, the evaluation metrics used to determine the optimality of the clusters, and the functional purpose of applying the techniques to improve the user experience of the website. By applying clustering techniques in different stages of the user activities in the online roadshow website, the advertising effectiveness of the website can be enhanced in terms of its affordance, flow, and interactivity.","2021-09","2023-10-20 07:43:18","2023-10-20 07:43:18","2023-10-20 07:43:18","233","","9","13","","","A Review on Clustering Techniques","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 9 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/WN7NG9CQ/Lim et al. - 2021 - A Review on Clustering Techniques Creating Better.pdf","","","clustering; evaluation metric; online roadshow; similarity measure; user experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predicting student‟s performance becomes more challenging due to the large volume of data in educational databases. Clustering is one of the method in data mining to analyze the massive volume of data. It categorizes data into clusters such that objects are grouped in the same cluster when they are similar according to specific metrics. This paper is designed to study and compare four clustering algorithms. The algorithms used for the research is k-Means, k-Medoids, Fuzzy C Means (FCM) and Expectation Maximization (EM). The main advantage of clustering is that interesting patterns and structures can be found directly from very large data sets with little or none of the background knowledge. The performance of the clustering algorithms is compared based on the factors: Purity, Normalized mutual information(NMI) and time taken to form cluster.","2018-01-01","2023-10-20 07:43:38","2023-10-20 07:43:38","","309-322","","","119","","International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/X2A6JQ5K/Govindasamy and Thambusamy - 2018 - Analysis of student academic performance using clu.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326239105_Analysis_of_student_academic_performance_using_clustering_techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although many studies have explored the efficacy, tolerability, adverse reactions, and functional mechanism of the disease, there has been no systematic evaluation of the relevant results in this field. AIM: This paper aims to analyze the theme trends and knowledge structure of drug therapy studies on MDD since the 21st century by employing bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Literature published in PubMed and related to drug therapy studies on MDD were retrieved between 2001 and 2018 in 6-year increments. After extracting major Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms/MeSH subheadings, bi-clustering analysis, social network analysis, and strategic diagrams were employed to complete bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 1,577, 2,680, 2,848 relevant research articles were retrieved for the periods during 2001-2006, 2007-2012, and 2013-2018, respectively. In line with strategic diagrams, the main undeveloped and peripheral theme clusters during 2001-2006 were functional mechanisms of antidepressants in pathophysiology, neuroendocrinology and neural biochemistry. These themes were replaced during 2007-2012 by clinical efficacy and influencing factors of antidepressants with or without psychotherapy, mechanisms of adverse reactions of antidepressants, and predictive studies of clinical therapeutic effects of antidepressants based on brain imaging. During 2013-2018 application and evaluation of new antidepressant agents, early identification and prevention of suicide of patients with MDD, as well as genetic- or bio-markers affecting the response and efficacy of antidepressants were the primary themes. Based on social network analyses, emerging hotspots, such as antidepressive agents, second-generation/adverse effects, depressive disorder, major/metabolism, psychotherapy/methods, and brain/drug effects could be identified during 2007-2012 and 2013-2018. CONCLUSIONS: These undeveloped theme clusters and emerging hotspots can be helpful for researchers to clarify the current status of their respective fields and future trends, and to generate novel ideas that may launch new research directions.","2020","2023-10-20 07:45:06","2023-10-20 07:45:06","","647","","","11","","Front Psychiatry","Research on the Development of Theme Trends and Changes of Knowledge Structures of Drug Therapy Studies on Major Depressive Disorder Since the 21st Century","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32754061 PMCID: PMC7367417","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/X8PWG69V/Duan et al. - 2020 - Research on the Development of Theme Trends and Ch.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754061","","bibliometric analysis; co-occurrence analysis; drug therapy; major depressive disorder; social network analysis; strategic diagram","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, we provide an efficient data mining methodology for analysis of social data sets which is capable of handling its natural challenges, such as mixed variables and abundance of null values. We use the Silhouette method for the estimation of the best number of natural groups within the data, along with the Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm in order to compute the profiles. The Correlation-Based Feature Selection method is used to identify which social criteria are the most important to differentiate the families from each profile. Classification models based on support vector machines, multilayer perceptron and decision trees were developed aiming to predict in which of the identified clusters an arbitrary family would be best fit.

The knowledge about student performance is fundamental to solve pedagogical challenges and to define different ways in teaching and learning. Following this trend, VLE provides extra information by reports, graphs and interface's alert. However, there is demand of statistical tools to support the teacher decisions, because the learning analysis is limited to frequency analysis. This paper discusses an analytical approach to deal with e-learning data. Our focus is to identify groups of learners based on their answers. Therefore, this paper pointed out some main objectives: understand profiles of answers in order to guide a student to future learning activities, and identify which criteria, in each group, is the most relevant for the tutor's help. Several techniques are useful for e-learning issues. However, we focus in Educational Data Mining (EDM) methodology. Our paper selected data of an English e-learning course from PSLC repository for case study in validation step. Preprocessing techniques of EDM were applied on selected dataset. Initially, we removed incomplete, noisy and inconsistent data of sample. After the preprocessing, we executed two steps: clustering and prediction analysis. Firstly, we executed the clustering process, because we needed to identify student's group based on their answers. After understanding the groups, we predicted behaviors of students on each cluster, which were defined in the last step. In our research, it defines that the prediction will use a regression methodology, and the clustering will execute K-means algorithm. The study identified five student's groups based on their answer, such as Expert, Good, Regular, Bad and Criticism answers. Consequently, the prediction analysis defined that the score of tutor's help (""Avg Assistance Score"") is the most interesting factor for our investigation. The approach executed the Stepwise Backward Regression, which is a semi-automated process of building a model by successively adding or removing variables based solely on the t-statistics of their estimated coefficients. Thus, other result is that the presence of the variables ""Incorrect"" and ""Correct First Attempts"" belongs to three regression models obtained by the approach. This work's findings presents knowledge about answers profiles of VLE students in two main perspectives. First, it analyzes the usage of Open Learning Data to characterize behavioral profiles of answers using multivariate analysis techniques. Second, our analysis contributes to expand present knowledge about how student performance changes the teacher decisions in VLE. This approach tends to be a useful tool in analytical process when the VLE system does not provide statistical tools.","2014-10","2023-10-20 07:47:12","2023-10-20 07:47:12","2023-10-20 07:47:12","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2377-634X","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/2DC6VXNC/7044401.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a cohesive hierarchical clustering based K-means clustering method is proposed and used for clustering analysis of typical scenarios of island power supply systems. At first, the source and load characteristics of a typical island power supply system are analyzed. Then, three characteristic indexes to distinguish island types are proposed which can achieve the feature extraction of typical scenarios of island power supply systems. On this basis, the cohesive hierarchical clustering based K-means clustering method is proposed for the clustering analysis of typical scenarios of the island power supply system. A case study is made to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The case study results indicate that the proposed method can effectively classify different islands into several types, and the features of the typical scenarios of each type of island are analyzed.","2021-11-01","2023-10-20 07:48:22","2023-10-20 07:48:22","2023-10-20 07:48:22","250-256","","","7","","Energy Reports","","2021 The 4th International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Green Energy","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/GZ6UMY3R/S235248472100651X.html","","","K-means clustering; Clustering analysis; Cohesive hierarchical clustering; Island power supply system; Scenario analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gaps in the network directly affect the security of the cloud as it is the foundation of it. Attacks in the cloud are launched either by compromised nodes of the network outside of the cloud or by virtual machines (VMs) within the cloud network. So, monitoring both external and internal traffic of the cloud network is of great importance. In this paper, a machine learning method performing accurate clustering of network data to detect DDoS attacks has been proposed. The method uses a feature selection technique to increase the efficiency of data clustering. To provide the feature selection the PCA algorithm has been used. For the dataset formed on selected features, the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise), Agglomerative Clustering, and k-means algorithms are applied. In the experiment, the clustering results of the methods using fewer features were higher on all metrics than the clustering results of the methods using all the features. Сompared to the standard algorithms, the PCA + DBSCAN, PCA + Agglomerative, and PCA + k-means algorithms obtained higher values on the Adjusted Rand Index metric and reached 0.8989, 0.9130, 0.9094 values, respectively. The effectiveness of the approach also was evaluated on the other clustering metrics and obtained high results. The proposed system can be installed in both internal and external cloud infrastructure. This allows, to detect attacks on the external cloud network, as well as on the internal physical network or in the virtual network between hypervisors.","2022-09-01","2023-10-20 07:48:37","2023-10-20 07:48:37","2023-10-20 07:48:37","100229","","","15","","Array","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/EUFWLSM4/S2590005622000686.html","","","Machine learning; Clustering; Cloud security; DDoS attacks; Feature selection; Network security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evaluation and filtering phase of prevalent SLR methodologies is therefore time consuming and hardly expressible to the intended audience. The proposed method applies natural language processing (NLP) on article meta data and a k-means clustering algorithm to automatically convert large article corpora into a distribution of focal topics. This allows efficient filtering as well as objectifying the process through the discussion of the clustering results. Beyond that, it allows to quickly identify scientific communities and therefore provides an iterative perspective for the so far linear SLR methodology.•NLP and k-means clustering to filter large article corpora during systematic literature reviews.•Automated clustering allows filtering very efficiently as well as effectively compared to manual selection.•Presentation and discussion of the clustering results helps to objectify the nontransparent filtering step in systematic literature reviews.","2020-01-01","2023-10-20 07:50:22","2023-10-28 10:18:19","2023-10-20 07:50:22","100831","","","7","","MethodsX","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Clustering; Systematic literature review; Literature filtering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current solutions on marketing provide a too general approach, pushing and suggesting on most cases, the popular or most purchased items, losing the focus on the customer centricity and personality. In this paper, a recommendation system for fashion retail shops is proposed, based on a multi clustering approach of items and users’ profiles in online and on physical stores. The proposed solution relies on mining techniques, allowing to predict the purchase behaviour of newly acquired customers, thus solving the cold start problems which is typical of the systems at the state of the art.

The concept originated in the USA, gaining interest from scholars in medicine, nutrition, nursing, and the gastronomic discipline. Notably, in the last five years, there has been exponential growth in CM literature. In this regard, this study sought to examine the growth, performance and distinct research themes of CM literature over time. Methods: To achieve the study’s objectives, this study employs descriptive, performance and bibliometric analysis. The descriptive analysis was applied to examine the growth of the CM literature since its emergence. The performance analysis was used to identify the most influential journals, articles, and authors in the CM domain. The bibliographic coupling analysis was adopted to discover the various research themes of the CM knowledge base. Results :&nbsp; This study identifies three stages of literature development: Early stage, modest growth stage, and emerging stage. Further, the results indicate that most of the studies on CM had been conducted in developed countries. Our findings reveal a clear interest in integrating the CM curriculum into medical/nutrition education programs in recent years. Additionally, the study discovers four distinct main research themes: knowledge assessment, impact measurement, acceptance and efficacy, and implementation of CM. Conclusions : These findings are helpful for scholars in medicine, nutrition, nursing, and gastronomy as they provide an overview of CM's development and research focus. Future studies could focus on expanding the geographical distribution of research on CM and further exploring the identified research themes to gain a deeper understanding of the potential of this approach for improving health outcomes among chronic disease patients.","2023-02-13","2023-10-20 07:53:09","2023-10-20 07:53:09","2023-10-20 07:53:09","","","","","","","Uncovering culinary medicine research themes","","","","","F1000Research","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","f1000research.com","","DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.130947.1 Type: article","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/4N52NHUG/Mallya et al. - 2023 - Uncovering culinary medicine research themes Curr.pdf","","","acceptance and efficacy; culinary medicine; gastronomy; impact measurement; implementation; knowledge assessment; nutrition; research themes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12:173","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that the hybrid model outperforms the individual models in two scenarios.","2022-01-01","2023-12-11 08:24:01","2024-02-02 02:08:02","2023-12-11 08:24:01","25-33","","","197","","Procedia Computer Science","","Sixth Information Systems International Conference (ISICO 2021)","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/WQL3PT6V/S1877050921023383.html","","","Calendar variation; dynamic harmonic regression; hybrid; short-term electricity load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: Our objective is to identify guidelines for reporting software engineering (SE) secondary studies which would address problems observed in the reporting of software engineering systematic reviews (SRs). Method: We review the criticisms of SE secondary studies and identify the major areas of concern. We assess the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement as a possible solution to the need for SR reporting guidelines, based on its status as the reporting guideline recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration whose SR guidelines were a major input to the guidelines developed for SE. We report its advantages and limitations in the context of SE secondary studies. We also assess reporting guidelines for mapping studies and qualitative reviews, and compare their structure and content with that of PRISMA 2020. Results: Previous tertiary studies confirm that reports of secondary studies are of variable quality. However, ad hoc recommendations that amend reporting standards may result in unnecessary duplication of text. We confirm that the PRISMA 2020 statement addresses SE reporting problems, but is mainly oriented to quantitative reviews, mixed-methods reviews and meta-analyses. However, we show that the PRISMA 2020 item definitions can be extended to cover the information needed to report mapping studies and qualitative reviews. Conclusions: In this paper and its Supplementary Material, we present and illustrate an integrated set of guidelines called SEGRESS (Software Engineering Guidelines for REporting Secondary Studies), suitable for quantitative systematic reviews (building upon PRISMA 2020), mapping studies (PRISMA-ScR), and qualitative reviews (ENTREQ and RAMESES), that addresses reporting problems found in current SE SRs.","2023-03","2024-03-19 01:55:48","2024-03-19 01:55:48","2024-03-19 01:55:48","1273-1298","","3","49","","","SEGRESS","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","/Users/markryan/Zotero/storage/UW97JDL3/Kitchenham et al. - 2023 - SEGRESS Software Engineering Guidelines for REpor.pdf","","","Evidence-based software engineering; Guidelines; mapping studies; mixed-methods reviews; PRISMA 2020; quality assessment; Quality assessment; quality reviews; reporting guidelines; risk of bias; Software; Software engineering; Standards; systematic reviews; Systematics; Terminology; threats to validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation.
